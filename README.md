## Concept: Self-Learning Tech Support Bot for Open-Source Software

### Description:
Develop a chatbot that assists users with troubleshooting issues in popular open-source software. The bot learns from user interactions, improving its responses over time.

#### Implementation Steps:
**Day 1-3**: Select 3-4 widely used open-source software applications (e.g., VLC, GIMP, LibreOffice). Compile common issues and solutions from community forums. \
**Day 4-7**: Use Gemini 1.5 Pro to create a conversational agent capable of providing troubleshooting steps. Implement a self-learning mechanism where the bot refines its knowledge base with each interaction. \
**Day 8-10**: Build a simple interface where users can interact with the bot and view past resolutions. Implement a feedback loop for users to rate the accuracy of the bot's responses.\
**Day 11-13**: Develop a feature for users to submit new issues that the bot doesn't yet know how to solve, storing them for human review and bot learning. \
**Day 14-16**: Test with users from open-source communities, iterating on the bot's learning algorithm based on feedback. \
**Day 17**: Finalize the bot's interface, ensure its knowledge base is robust, and prepare a demo highlighting its self-learning capabilities. 

Why It Stands Out: The self-learning aspect of the bot, along with its focus on open-source software, provides a unique twist that can appeal to the tech-savvy audience often involved in hackathons.
